```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Your project goes here! Before you submit, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`. 

You can add sections as you see fit. Make sure you have a section called Introduction at the beginning and a section called Conclusion at the end. The rest is up to you!
